        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
         <p> Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, 
           and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
           <h2>Chemical Elements</h2> 
           <p>The <span style="background-color: yellow;">periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements.
           Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron. H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. 
           Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
           <h3>Chemical Equations</h3> Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations.
           Here's an example of a <dfn>chemical reaction</dfn>:</p>
           2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O
           <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas  <em>(H₂)</em> and oxygen gas <em>(O2)</em> to form water <em>(H₂O)</em>.</p>
           <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
           <p><dfn> <strong>Stoichiometry</strong></dfn> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.
           It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
           <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup> superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
           <h5>Conclusion</h5>
           <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us.
           From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, 
           chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
